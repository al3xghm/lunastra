      "paragraph": "Our understanding of time and space was revolutionized by Albert Einstein’s discoveries. With special relativity, he demonstrated that time is not absolute but flows differently depending on an observer’s speed. General relativity later revealed that gravity bends spacetime, affecting the path of light and shaping the very structure of the universe. From the thought experiment of a moving train to the gravitational bending of light, this exhibition invites you to explore the groundbreaking concepts that transformed our perception of reality.",
